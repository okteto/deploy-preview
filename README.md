## Github Action for Creating a Preview environment in Okteto

You can use this action to create a preview environment in Okteto as part of your automated development workflow.

## Inputs

### `name`

**Required**  The name of the Okteto preview environment to create.

### `timeout`

The length of time to wait for completion. Values should contain a corresponding time unit e.g. 1s, 2m, 3h. If not specified it will use `5m`.

### `variables`

A list of variables to be used by the pipeline. If several variables are present, they should be separated by commas e.g. VAR1=VAL1,VAR2=VAL2,VAR3=VAL3.

### `file`

Relative path within the repository to the manifest file (default to okteto-pipeline.yaml or .okteto/okteto-pipeline.yaml).

### `branch`

The branch to use for the preview environment (defaults to the branch that triggered the action).

### `log-level`

Log level used. Supported values are: `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`. (defaults to `warn`)

## Environment Variables

If the `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable is set, this action will automatically post a comment on the Pull Request that triggered it, including the preview environment URL and its available endpoints.

## Example usage

This example runs the context action and then creates a preview environment.

```yaml
# File: .github/workflows/workflow.yml
on: [push]

name: example

concurrency:
  # more info here: https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#concurrency
  group: ${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.ref }}
  cancel-in-progress: false

jobs:
  devflow:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - name: Context
      uses: okteto/context@latest
      with:
        url: https://okteto.example.com
        token: ${{ secrets.OKTETO_TOKEN }}

    - name: "Deploy the preview environment"
      uses: okteto/deploy-preview@latest
      env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
      with:
        name: dev-previews-${{ github.event.number }}
```

## Advanced usage

### Custom Certification Authorities or Self-signed certificates

You can specify a custom certificate authority or a self-signed certificate by setting the `OKTETO_CA_CERT` environment variable. When this variable is set, the action will install the certificate in the container, and then execute the action.

Use this option if you're using a private Certificate Authority or a self-signed certificate in your [Okteto SH](https://www.okteto.com/docs/self-hosted/) instance.  We recommend that you store the certificate as an [encrypted secret](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets), and that you define the environment variable for the entire job, instead of doing it on every step.


```yaml
# File: .github/workflows/workflow.yml
on: [push]

name: example

concurrency:
  # more info here: https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#concurrency
  group: ${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.ref }}
  cancel-in-progress: false

jobs:
  devflow:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    env:
      OKTETO_CA_CERT: ${{ secrets.OKTETO_CA_CERT }}

    steps:
    - name: Context
      uses: okteto/context@latest
      with:
        url: https://okteto.example.com
        token: ${{ secrets.OKTETO_TOKEN }}

    - name: "Deploy the preview environment"
      uses: okteto/deploy-preview@latest
      with:
        name: dev-previews
        timeout: 15m
```
